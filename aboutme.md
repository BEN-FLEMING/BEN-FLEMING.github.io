✨ Research Scientist at Imperial College developing software in the neuroimaging domain ✨

I graduated from University of Birmingham in 2021 with a MSc in CS. Seeking software/machine learning engineer roles and have experience with Python 3, Machine Learning, Java, SQL, Linux and Bash. Experience with full-stack software engineering projects alongside machine learning research projects.

Most recently, I developed a series of convolutional neural networks to detect Alzheimer's Disease from MRI images with 70% accuracy.

My interests are broadly in software engineering, machine learning and neuroscience.
